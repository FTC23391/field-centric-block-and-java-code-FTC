# field-centric-block-and-java-code-FTC
This is a download and .png file of a field centric block code, again field centric is what FRC uses where you can be facing any direction and push the joystick anywhere and it will go there. A java file version will be linked. If we every get a youtube channel we will link the channel and vodeo for field centric.
